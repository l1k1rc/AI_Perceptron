# AI_Perceptron
### Description
This code declare a Perceptron object into a class with activity Heaviside function and error Widrow-Hoff function.
This program allows the learning of 2 perceptrons, one for the recognition of the letter A and the other for the letter B. 
The objective is to declare the object by its class and to use the methods implemented inside to train it N times. 
Moreover, the display methods allow to obtain logs on the calculations and a graph listing the variations of the 
weights after calculation of the error function.
